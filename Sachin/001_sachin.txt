On a number line lies n bombs located at distinct positions. The i-th bomb is at position ai and strength level bi. When the i-th bomb explodes, it destroys all bombs to its left (towards decreasing coordinates) within distance bi inclusive. 
The bomb itself is not destroyed (magic bombs). Sulemaan sultaani will fire the bombs one at a time from right to left. If a bomb is destroyed, it cannot be fired again.

Sulemaan sultaani wants Sulemaan bajrangi to add a bomb strictly to the right of all the existing bombs, with any strength and any coordinate, such that the least possible number of bombs are destroyed.
Note that Sulemaan bajrangi's placement of bomb means it will be the first bomb fired. Help Sulemaan bajrangi finding the minimum number of bombs that could be destroyed.

Input
first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the initial number of bombs.

The i-th of next n lines contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ bi ≤ 1 000 000) — the coordinate and strength level of the i-th bomb respectively. No two bomb will have the same position, so if i ≠ j then ai ≠ aj .

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum number of bombs that could be destroyed if exactly one bomb is added.
